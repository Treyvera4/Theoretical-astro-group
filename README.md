# Theoretical-astro-group
This repository is for storing code used in the theoretical astrophysics research group led by Stefano Profumo at UC Santa Cruz. This group was a part of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics(SCIPP).

I am also using this repository as a way to practice the work flow of Github.
